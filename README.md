# KNN_Implementation

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch, along with variations and enhancements. The goal is to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors, exploring different distance metrics and feature weighting techniques to improve performance.
